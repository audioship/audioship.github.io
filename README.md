## Using the Instrument

### Who is the expected user? 
The expected users of this instrument are anyone who wants to put their listening skills to the test. It's designed such that the performers do not need to have any prior experience, just the ability to listen and make out the opposing players frequencies of ships.

### Expected use case
The expected use case is in staged performance setting. The two players are to sit on the stage facing away from a screen that is behind them, with the audience sitting in front of them. Thereby, the players are actively playing the game, while the audience is listening to the emergent sound scape as well as being able to track the progress of the game over the screen behind the player.


### How is the instrument played? What kinds of sounds are produced?
The instrument is played using two buttons and a knob. The darker button on each of the instruments fires a shot at the opponent. If the frequency of this shot matches the frequency of any of the opposing player's ships, that ship will be destroyed. The knob changes the frequency of your active ship, which you can utilize to match the frequencies that you hear coming from the opposing player's ships. The lighter knob button on each of the instruments changes the active ship. Each player starts with four ships and can rotate through in shooting and changing frequencies.

The sounds that are produced are that of a space battle soundscape. There is ambient space sounds that play in the backdrop of the entire game. When the players shoot, a shot sound effect is made with whatever frequency has been indicated by the player. If a player hits an opposing player's ship, there will be an explosion sound effect to indicate it has been destroyed.
